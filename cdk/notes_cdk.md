## CDK

## Constructs

- Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) applications.
- A construct is a component within your application that represents one or more AWS CloudFormation resources and their configuration.
- You build your application, piece by piece, by importing and configuring constructs.
