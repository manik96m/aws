# 6 R’s of migration

- Rehosting - move applications as is to AWS
- Replatforming - move applications with minor cloud optimizations.
- Retire - retire applications not being used
- Retain - might be deprecated, no need to migrate or applications that need major refactoring before migration
- Repurchasing - change license providers to cloud native solutions
- Refactoring - Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.
